				Honey Badgers are pitch black in colour, with a white or grey brown saddle running from the forehead all the way to the tip of the tail. 
				They are built for strength with a compacted body and have an enormous skull which contains a powerful jaw structure with robust teeth. 
				They also love to eat honey as their name suggests, and the stings of bees donâ€™t stop them from getting to it.
